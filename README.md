### Project Description
Creation of UI Automation framework to automate the Hudl login page.

### Tech Stack 
- Selenium WebDriver is used to interact with the Web applications.
- Java language is used to write the scripts.
- TestNG is used for test execution.
- Cucumber is used to support the BDD automation.
- Extent reports are used to display the reports.

### Setup
- Install Java using the [link](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-java-windows) and set the environment variables.
- Download Eclipse 64 bit and place it in a new folder in the local drive.
- Create a new Maven project in eclipse and add the below dependencies in the pom.xml file
```

```
- The output can be viewed in the form of Extent reports
- To view the output , after the execution refresh the project and view the reports in (project -> reports -> result.html (open in System editor).

### Framework Design
- The Browser Actions and DOM Elements actions are created as interfaces, which is implemented in the BaseMethods which acts as library for Wrapper methods.
- The ProjectSepecificMethods acts as the Base class which has common methods specific to the project like the entry and exit of the application.
- This framework is designed based on the Page Object model pattern, where each page is implemeted in a class using Java.
- The Utility package has the classes related to external applications (Reporter)
- It follows the BDD approach using Cucumber, where Feature files are created and called by the step definition classes (page class).
- The testcases are called from the tests class (Runner class) where the features and the step definitions are mapped.
- The execution is done through the TestNG.xml where the tests classes are called.

### Execution Flow
```
@BeforeSuite --> Reporter (beginReport)
	@BeforeTest --> Tests_class (setValues)
		@BeforeClass --> Reporter (report)
				@BeforeMethod --> ProjectSpecificMethods (initiateApp)
					The tests_class is executed that is available in the testNg.xml (Tests_LoginModule)
				@AfterMethod --> ProjectSpecificMethods (closeApp)
		@AfterClass --> No Method
	@AfterTest --> No Method
@AfterSuite	--> Reporter (endReport)
```
- **Steps to run** 
  - The system should have java and MVN to run scripts
  - Copy the code from git to the local 
  - Run the below command in command prompt from the project folder.
      `mvn install test`

### Features
- **Login Feature**
	- To validate the login page of Hudl.com with valid credentials
	- To validate if the links such as Sign_Up , Need_help are accessible from the login page.
	- Negative Test - To validate the login page of Hudl with invalid credentials

### Enhancements
- This framework can be extended to perform the validation of all the pages in the Hudl.com application
- This framework can be extended to use the mail verfication for functionalities such as Sign_in and Reset_Password using Mailinatour dependencies.
- This framework can be extended to obtain data from excel sheets using the Apachi_POI dependencies.
