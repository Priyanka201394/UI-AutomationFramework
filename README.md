### Project Description
Creation of UI Automation framework to automate the Hudl login page.

### Tech Stack 
- Selenium WebDriver is used to interact with the Web applications.
- Java language is used to write the scripts.
- TestNG is used for test execution.
- Cucumber is used to support the BDD automation.
- Extent reports are used to display the reports.

### Setup
- Download and install Java from official oracle site or java site using the [link](https://www.oracle.com/uk/java/technologies/downloads/). 
- Set the environment variables and path for Java (Refer link - https://www.qamadness.com/knowledge-base/how-to-install-maven-and-configure-environment-variables/ )
- Download maven from official apache site (https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and set the environmenet variables and path for Maven in your machine. ( Refer Link - https://www.qamadness.com/knowledge-base/how-to-install-maven-and-configure-environment-variables/)
- Using command line run commands java -version and mvn -version to confirm the java and maven availability in your machine.
- Download Eclipse 64 bit and place it in a new folder in the local drive.
- Create a new Maven project in eclipse and add the below dependencies in the pom.xml file
```

### Framework Design
- The Browser Actions and DOM Elements actions are created as interfaces, which is implemented in the BaseMethods which acts as library for Wrapper methods.
- The ProjectSepecificMethods acts as the Base class which has common methods specific to the project like the entry and exit of the application.
- This framework is designed based on the Page Object model pattern, where each page is implemeted in a class using Java.
- The Utility package has the classes related to external applications (Reporter)
- It follows the BDD approach using Cucumber, where Feature files are created and called by the step definition classes (page class).
- The testcases are called from the tests class (Runner class) where the features and the step definitions are mapped.
- The execution is done through the TestNG.xml where the tests classes are called and browsers are defined (currently tests are run in chrome and edge which can be extended)
- The config.properties file has the properties such as username, password, website_url , Headless ( default value is set to false) for easier access.

### Execution Flow
```
@BeforeSuite --> Reporter (beginReport)
	@BeforeTest --> Tests_class (setValues)
		@BeforeClass --> Reporter (report)
				@BeforeMethod --> ProjectSpecificMethods (initiateApp)
					The tests_class is executed that is available in the testNg.xml (Tests_LoginModule)
				@AfterMethod --> ProjectSpecificMethods (closeApp)
		@AfterClass --> No Method
	@AfterTest --> No Method
@AfterSuite	--> Reporter (endReport)
```
- **Steps to run** 
  - System should have compatible java and MVN versions to run the scripts.
  - Download and copy the code from git to the local directory.
  - Open the command line from the project path where the pom.xml file is available.
  - Run the command `mvn install test` for 1st time run and there after we can run using command `mvn test`
  - Reports will be saved in the path <ProjectName>/reports/results.html which can be viewed through the system editor and screenshots will be placed in <ProjectName>/reports/images folder

### Features
- **Login Feature**
	- To validate the login page of Hudl.com with valid credentials
	- To validate if the links such as Sign_Up , Need_help are accessible from the login page.
	- Negative Test - To validate the login page of Hudl with invalid credentials

### Enhancements
- This framework can be extended to perform the automation of all the pages in the Hudl.com application
- This framework can be extended to use the mail verfication for functionalities such as Sign_in and Reset_Password using Mailinatour dependencies.
- This framework can be extended to interact with data from excel sheets using the Apachi_POI dependencies.
- This framework can also be extended to perform API testing through Karate or Rest assured libraries.
- The framework can be deployed in a CICD tool for build, test an deploy and can be configured to run regularly scheduled tests.

**Note**
- Considering the assumption that a wider team is using Selenium with BDD & POM, I have implemented the framework using the same. However I have considered Java as a scripting language due to my personal knowledge and also ease of standardisation, libraries and verbosity.
- On top of implementing the UI framework for login, I have created the Postman API collections with assertions to test the Login API with consideration that the team has access to the Postman tool. This collection will become handy to test the Login service as soon as the API is deployed even before UI is made available. To execute the API tests, download the API collections and import them in Postman then run collections.
